# IN3110-ctweiden

This is the repository where you will do all assignments for IN3110 or 4110.

You can clone it with:

    git clone git@github.uio.no:IN3110/IN3110-ctweiden

Assignments will be completed in the `assignment1`, `assignment2`, etc. folders of this repo. They should have these exact names. There should be no reason to create files outside these folders for this course.

Turning in an assignment is pushing to this repo. There are no other actions to take, other than double-checking https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-ctweiden for the correct contents.

Always make sure that you push to the repo at `IN3110/IN3110-ctweiden`, and _not_ `ctweiden/IN3110-ctweiden`. Pushing to your own fork __is not__ turning in the assignment.


Assignments and the assignment schedule are published at http://pages.github.uio.no/IN3110/assignments/assignments/
